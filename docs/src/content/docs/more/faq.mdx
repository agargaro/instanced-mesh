// When not to use?
// why don't instances update?
// why do they suddenly disappear?
// don't use instancedBufferAttribute.
// updateInstances doesn't update instances correctly. Are you using createEntities? // otherwise you have no persistent state.
// when I start from 0 instances and add instances later, raycasting doesn't work. Use BVH or watch out for the boundingbox
