description: Optimize performance using Level of Detail (LOD) in InstancedMesh2.

Using **Level of Detail (LOD)** in `InstancedMesh2` helps optimize performance by dynamically swapping geometry and materials based on the camera distance. This reduces rendering overhead for distant objects.

## Adding LOD to InstancedMesh2

To define multiple LOD levels for an `InstancedMesh2`, use the `.addLOD()` method. Each LOD level consists of a geometry, material, and a distance threshold.
