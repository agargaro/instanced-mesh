title: Use Rotation Property

### Managing Rotation in `InstancedEntity`

By default, rotation in [`InstancedEntity`](https://agargaro.github.io/instanced-mesh/api/classes/instancedentity) is handled using 
[`quaternion`](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/core/Object3D.quaternion), while the 
[`rotation`](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/core/Object3D.rotation) property 
(of type [`Euler`](https://threejs.org/docs/?q=euler#api/en/math/Euler)) is disabled.

This design choice avoids the computational overhead of keeping `quaternion` and `rotation` synchronized, as both representations must be 
updated simultaneously for consistency.

### Enabling the `rotation` Property

If you prefer to work with `Euler` angles instead of quaternions, you can enable the `rotation` property by setting the 
[`allowsEuler`](https://agargaro.github.io/instanced-mesh/api/interfaces/instancedmesh2params/#allowseuler) flag in the constructor:

```ts
const iMesh = new InstancedMesh2(geo, mat, { createEntities: true, allowsEuler: true });
```

Enabling this option allows you to modify rotation using `Euler` angles but comes with a minor performance trade-off due to the additional 
synchronization required.

### Example

In this example, each instance is rotated using the `rotation` property:
