title: Add and Remove Instances
---

You can add instances without specifying a length: buffers will automatically expand as needed. <br/>
To set a specific initial buffer capacity, set the [`capacity`](https://agargaro.github.io/instanced-mesh/api/interfaces/instancedmesh2params/#capacity)
 in the constructor parameters:

```ts
const iMesh = new InstancedMesh2(geo, mat, { capacity: 10000 });
```

### Add Instances

```ts
iMesh.addInstances(count, (obj, index) => {
  obj.position.x = index;
  obj.quaternion.random();
});
```

### Remove Instances

It's possible to remove instances by their IDs. When an instance is removed:
- The instance is marked as inactive
- Its ID is stored in a pool of available IDs
- The slot is automatically reused when adding new instances

```ts
iMesh.removeInstances(id0, id1, ...);
```

### Clear Instances

```ts
iMesh.clearInstances();
```

### Example

In this example, instances can be added and removed by clicking:
