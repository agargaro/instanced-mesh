title: Tween
---

[If an array of instances has been created](https://agargaro.github.io/instanced-mesh/basics/00-Instancedentity/), 
you can apply tween animations to properties such as `position`, `scale`, `quaternion`, and `rotation`. 

:::caution
The `color` property **cannot** be tweened because it is a getter that retrieves values from an internal array.
:::

## Example

The following example demonstrates how to use tweens to animate instance transformations.

:::note
This example leverages the [`@three.ez/main`](https://github.com/agargaro/three.ez) package for tween animations, 
but you can use any tweening library of your choice!
