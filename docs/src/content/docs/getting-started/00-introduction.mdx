`InstancedMesh2` is an alternative version of `InstancedMesh` with enhanced features for performance and usability:
- **Per-instance frustum culling**: *skip rendering for out-of-view instances.*
- **Sorting**: *reduce overdraw and manage transparent objects efficiently.*
- **Spatial indexing (dynamic BVH)**: *speed up raycasting and frustum culling.*
- **Dynamic capacity**: *add or remove instances seamlessly.*
- **Per-instance visibility and opacity**: *toggle visibility and set opacity for each instance individually.*
- **Object3D-like instances**: *use instances like `Object3D` with transforms and custom data.*
- **Per-instance uniforms**: *assign unique shader data to individual instances.*
- **Level of Detail (LOD)**: *dynamically adjust instance detail based on distance.*
- **Shadow LOD**: *optimize shadow rendering with lower detail for distant instances.*
- **Skinning**: *apply skeletal animations to instances for more complex and dynamic movements.*

:::note 
It currently only works with `WebGLRenderer` and `three.js r159+`.

### Differences with `InstancedMesh`

`InstancedMesh` uses an `InstancedBufferAttribute` to store instances matrices and data, and rendering occurs sequentially.

`InstancedMesh2` uses a `DataTexture` to store instances matrices and data, while using an `InstancedBufferAttribute` 
to manage the indexes of the instances to be rendered.

:::caution 
Because of indirection, the rendering of all instances is slightly slower. <br/>
If none of the features are used, it is better to use `InstancedMesh`.
